Repository for 'Fire Swipe'

'Fire Swipe' is coded in Processing 3. This is my first personal project and experience with coding. Finished September 24, 2017.

'Fire Swipe' is an endurance-based arcade game in which a player scores by swiping the 'ice block' across the screen in between moving 'fire balls'. The speed at which the 'fire balls' move increases as the player's score increases. The player has three lives. A player loses a life if the 'ice block' touches one of the 'fire balls'. Upon losing all three lives, the player's score is shown as well as the highscore of the application's current runtime. The player wins the game if they get a score of 50.

FireSwipe is the main class the application runs on. The logic and design of the application is housed within the class.

FireBall represents the 'fire balls' moving down the screen.

IceBlock represents the 'ice block' the player swipes across the screen.
